# minutes-logger

Arduino application to log and track your minutes.

This is the source code for my Arduino Uno minutes tracker project. 
Feel free to download and use the code if you're not interested in coding if yourself.

# using the program

To use the code, first open the Arduino source code in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your Uno.
Then, to start tracking, open the Processing source code with the Processing IDE and run it.
With this code running, all your minutes will be tracked and put into the data folder.
